# Getting Started with Create React App

# About the developers
This project is a collaboration of two up and coming developers, Jason Hull and Mei Gorbachik.

# About the App
WELCOME TO TRACK A TRAIN v .1.0 !!

This project tackles one of the lesser know problems in todays society. That is how long will a train take to pass through a busy intersection. Oten commuters are faced with the problem of waiting for a train to pass but have no idea how long it will take. This can lead to unexpected problems such as being late for a meeting or even just being stuck in traffic when there are alternate routes to take. Sometimes this issue is unavoidlable but this app will help estimate the wait time and provide peace of mind for commuters. NOTE: This is application is a work in progress and will be updated soon.
